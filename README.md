# BellmanFordAlgorithm

A simple Java implementation of BellmanFord Algorithm 

The algorithm finds the shortest path cost from a source vertex, to every other edge in the graph.
The graph is represented using the adjacent matrics which makes the running time of the algorithm is O(V^3), if the adjacent list is used to represented the graph the running time will be O(VE) , where V is the number of the vertex and E is the edges number.
